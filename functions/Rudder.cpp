/*
 * This is based on a 'KUS' rudder angle guage.  It is a potentiometer
 * which varies its resistance from 0 - 190 Ohms depending on the angle
 * I use a potential divider.  i.e. a 190 Ohm resistor between the 5v
 * and the Level 2 connector, I then run one terminal from the Level 2
 * connector to the rudder guage.  Then another line from the other
 * side of the guage to GND connecter near the Level 2 connector.
 * this then means I get a reading of 0 - 813 depending on position.
 * I need to calibrate this but 512 should be dead centre.
 *
 * I am guestimating about 90 degrees of travel.
